## Dynamic Arrays

*See DataStructureDemo.cs*


Arrays are terrible. They are error prone and difficult to work with. One way we can solve this by sort of wrapping it in a class.

This is sort of an Abstract Data Type.

The array is represented by an private member. We add elements without thinking about it.

The array can be an array of type Object so that it can hold elements of any type.

## Linked List

A Linked list is a data structure that connects a list of objects of the same class using a reference to the next link in the chain.

Example: LinkedList and LinkedListManager

Lots of helper functions are needed to implement these.

## Parameterized Types (Generics)

For classes such as these, the "type" of object stored can be substituted.

For example, see; DynamicArrayWithParameter<T>

## What is a "Type"?

A Type is the collection of methods that you can call on an objects. Methods are also known as operations. Think of it as giving commands to the object or making the object do stuff.

See my article for examples.


## State

The set of the current values of an object is called its state.
